# crypto collab

A repository for feature extraction on cryptocurrency trading data.

Part 1:
Features engineered were simple moving averages, exponential weighted means, fourier coefficients using the fast fourier transform, and a column with the fisher transform to make the distribution more normal.

Part 2:
For the coins EOS, NEO, Ripple, and Ethereum, over 1 hour intervals, we scraped trading data from Bitfinex and portrayed it using relevant plots, such as line graphs to display the amount traded or price and its dependency on time, and/or histograms to portray the size distribution of the transactions.
